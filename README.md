# What a Handy Display!
_Hmm... I'm getting some deja vu... Don't I already have a Handy Display?_

## Status Update

This is a Kotlin re-write of my Python Handy Display project. 
I originally chose Python because of the Raspberry Pi's native/pre-installed support for it, but I found that Python struggled to keep up with the massive number of operations needed to convert from 8-8-8 colours to 5-6-5 colours, even when using C acceleration.
I also discovered that I don't really like the Python language, even after a lot of hours of using it - I found it hard to read and messy, even when looking at "ideal" Python examples.
I also just want to learn Kotlin because it seems like Java but just really _**nice**_...

## The Original README:

This is the software section of an electronics project I've wanted to try for several years (as of this writing in
2023).

The Handy Display is a TFT LCD which I am driving from my ancient Raspberry Pi 2B+ which I haven't so far gotten
much use out of. The Handy Display is written in Python and displays all kinds of helpful information about my calendar,
the weather and anything else I'll care to add a widget for.
